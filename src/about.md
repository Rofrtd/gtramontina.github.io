# About me

Hello there! Welcome to my little corner of the web. My name is <span lang="pt-BR">Guilherme Johansson Tramontina</span>. I develop software for living. I'm currently working as a consultant with [Pragmateam](https://pragma.team), in the beautiful [Sydney, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney).

## Social Media

I'm not an avid user of social media. In fact, I try to avoid it as much as I can. There are, though, a few that I end up using more than I'd like to. Here's how you can find me (in rough order of activity):

# About this website

The ideas and opinions expressed here are my own. Actually, they are the result of an amalgamation of things. Reading, listening to podcasts, attending conferences and meetups, hallway conversations, life. So Iâ€™m thankful to those who I crossed paths with for helping shape my ideas and opinions. Thank you! That said, it doesn't mean they can't chance. Let's chat!
